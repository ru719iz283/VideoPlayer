# Introduction 
	This is a video player developed in windows base on Qt5.7.0
	I used the _FFMPEG_ library for connect/decode the RTSP video
	And get the video/audio codec from _FFMPEG_ library
	Count the GOP by myself
	
	This program could play RTSP video and display the video/audio codec, GOP , and video resolution
	
# How to use this

	Download and extra the file.
	Execute the bin/QtVideoPlayer.exe
		Click connect button in the tool
		
	The tool will play the video within 1~2 seconds

	You can modity the RTSP url for selecting different video source
